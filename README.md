# Play With Sand

## Basic Sand Simulator

This project, inspired by and learned from The Coding Train, is a basic sand simulator. It's an interactive web application that allows users to create and manipulate a virtual sand environment, offering a simple yet engaging experience in exploring the basics of particle simulation.

### Application Overview

The Sand Simulator is a creative and educational tool that visually represents the behavior of sand particles. Users can interact with the simulation to create dynamic and colorful patterns, mimicking the physical properties of sand.

#### Key Features:

- **Particle Simulation**: Simulate the movement and interaction of sand particles.
- **Color Interaction**: Choose from a variety of colors to paint the sand, including a rainbow mode for multicolored effects.
- **Brush Size Toggle**: Adjust the size of the brush to control the number of particles placed.
- **Pause/Resume**: Ability to pause and resume the simulation.
- **Canvas Interaction**: Users can click and drag on the canvas to deposit sand particles.

### Getting Started

To run the Sand Simulator, you can do any one of the following:
1. Simply open the `/public/index.html` file in a modern web browser. The application is entirely client-side, requiring no additional installation or server setup. (No Sound effects)
2. Run the SAND.exe file followed with ctrl+click on http://localhost:3000.
3. Run the SAND.bat file followed with ctrl+click on http://localhost:3000.

### Usage

Upon loading the application, you will be presented with a canvas where the sand simulation takes place. Below are the controls for interaction:

- **Color Buttons**: Click to select different colors for the sand particles.
- **Rainbow Mode**: Activates a mode where sand particles cycle through various colors.
- **Brush Size Button**: Toggle between different brush sizes for particle placement.
- **Pause/Resume Button**: Temporarily stop the movement of the sand particles, and resume it.
- **Clear Canvas Button**: Clears the canvas for a fresh start.
